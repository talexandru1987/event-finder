# Description

Are you looking for the best events in town? With What's On, discover new places, artists, foods and more with your friends and family! Enter your current location and see the latest events with a click of a button!

# The What's On Experience

When a user lands on the homepage, they are presented with a search bar where they can add their location e.g. Orlando. When the search button is pressed, they are taken to a new page where a list of upcoming events are displayed.

A user can sign up and login. When a user is logged in, they can save their choice of events and send them to their friends.

Even if the user is not logged in, they can still search for events in their chosen location.

# Conclusion

To conclude, this was a very fun and challenging project. We successfully load a variety of event cards for a given location. A preferred event can be saved. Bringing in the Web API, rather than just seeding the database ourselves, bought its own challenges which we faced successfully!
